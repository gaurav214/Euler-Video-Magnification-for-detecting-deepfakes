# Euler-Video-Magnification-for-detecting-deepfakes

This paper shows the results of a series of experimentation done to check effectiveness of Euler magnification in detecting deepfake videos. Focus of this experimentation was based on the hypothesis:

"" Fake videos do not have subtle facial color changes which are only visible in Euler magnification of real videos"

Experiments verify:

1. Generative adversarial networks effectiveness in creating deepfakes
2. Analysis of hearbeat by just looking at a still video of a person
3. Best ways to perform Euler magnificatio
4. Frequency domain analysis of fake and real images
